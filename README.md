# MUSA-620-Week-10
Advanced data visualization, D3

Today we will get a taste of JavaScript and D3. A JavaScript IDE is not necessary for today's class, but will make things much easier. If you already have a JavaScript IDE set up, you can skip this. Otherwise, here are instructions for getting set up with Atom:
- Download the latest version from [atom.io](https://atom.io/).
- Once open, press the "Install a Package" button and install the "atom-live-server" package.
- Create a new folder for today's project. Then go to File > Add Project Folder and select the folder you just created.
